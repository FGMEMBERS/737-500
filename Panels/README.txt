This is for a 737-800,NG with duel panel(Capts & FO's).This README
is mainly to let you know how the panel works.
But first I would like to thank Gene Buckle and the people at
Simpits for their 737 panel which I used extensively as a template.
Without that the panel would have been much harder to do.
David Culp for the FDM for the 737 which you will find is much
more realistic than most other sim's and improving all the time.
To all the guy's at Flight Gear that made the making of this panel
possible.

How does it work.
1)The radio panel
	To use the radio panel the buttons at the side of each frequency adjust the frequency and switch the active frequency.
	To adjust the frequency press the left or right side of the
	button adjacent to the green(standby)frequency.
	To swap the active and standby frequencies press the button
	adjacent the white(active) frequency.
	The ADF frequencies are adjusted and changed by the buttons
	on the right hand side of the panel.
	The only other thing on the radio panel is a switch to activate
	the DME in the PFD2(EADI).This is located beside the large knob on
	the bottom of the panel and is marked DME.
2)The autopilot/autothrottle panel
	All the knobs,Course,IAS/MACH,heading,Altitude and Vert Speed
	are adjusted by pressing on the left or right of the knob.Except the
	Vert Speed which is by pressing on the top or the bottom.
	The activation swiches will show two yellow dots when they are
	active.
	Currently the only swiches that are active are.
	On the autothrottle the speed swich
	On the autopilot the heading sel,vor/loc,app,alt hld and v/s
	Note the HDG SEL does not seem to work correctly.But were working on it.
	To operate the autopilot you have to engage the autopilot
	using the autopilot A CMD switch.Note you may have to move the panel
	slightly to the right to see this switch.
	To disengage the autopilot you need to press the disengage bar.
	In the same area.
	To operate the autothrottle the arm switch must be activated.To
	do this press in the area of the word ARM.The little bar under the word
	ARM will turn white.But it is hard to see.To switch it off press off
	If the switches dont work it will because the autopilot/autothrottle is not engaged/armed
	There are currently no other switches on the panel.

	Flap guage and under that the leading edge flap indicating lights.
	To the right of the flap guage is the undercarriage warning lights.
	And on the very right is the clock.

All the rest for the moment is eye candy but will be made operational
when time and properties become available.

If you have any problems or suggestions please address them through the
lists at Flight Gear.
Enjoy the aircraft and the panel
